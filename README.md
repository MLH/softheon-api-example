# Sample Softheon Node.js Library

This library is meant to demonstrate the capabilities of the Softheon API
through the eyes of an MLH hacker.  This is not meant for production, it's
just meant to be an example!

## Examples:

 - [Create a Payment](examples/create_a_payment.js) - Add a customer's 
   Credit Card to your account and charge it using the returned token.
